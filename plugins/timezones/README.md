# timezones - Albert plugin

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following python packages installed:

- `Pillow`
- `pytz`
- `requests`
- `tzlocal`
- `thefuzz`
- `pycountry`

## Description

Lookup time zones based on either the city or the country name. The plugin will
autocomplete all the appropriate city and country names based on fuzzy search
and will always show your current country/city on top so that you can easily
compare

On top it will always show you your local timezone so that you can compare.

Thanks to <https://flagpedia.net/> for the country logos
